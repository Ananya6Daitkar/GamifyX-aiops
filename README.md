# Gamifyx-AIOps â€” Assignment-ready starter repo

## What this is
A small, ready-to-edit project that implements:
- Minimal frontend (Next.js placeholder)
- Minimal backend (Express API)
- Mock AIOps helpers (PR summary + risk gate)
- GitHub Actions pipeline with CI stages and simulated AIOps steps
- Documentation for Assignment 1 & 2 deliverables

## Quick start (run locally)
1. Open two terminals.
2. Start backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Start frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open browser: http://localhost:3000 and API at http://localhost:4000

## What to edit for the assignment
- Update `README.md` with your GitHub repo link and screenshots.
- Replace mock AIOps scripts with real LLM calls if you want.
- Push to GitHub and enable Actions (the workflow file is at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Deliverables included
- problem-statement.md
- one-liner + why
- skills-map.md
- six-week-roadmap.md
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` â€” baseline + AIOps features simulated
- `evidence/` folder with placeholders

Good luck â€” edit, run, record the demo, and submit! ðŸš€
