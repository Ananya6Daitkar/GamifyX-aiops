# Problem Statement (<=150 words)

Teaching DevOps is often dry and hard to follow. Students lose interest when lessons are purely lecture-based,
and instructors struggle to track who is progressing and who needs help. This project uses gamification (leaderboards,
prizes) and AIOps (automated monitoring, PR feedback, and performance prediction) to make DevOps learning engaging,
measurable, and supportive. The demo will show a working CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, scans, and deploys,
plus two AIOps features: an AI PR assistant (mocked) and a risk-aware gate that can block risky deploys.
The demo goal: show end-to-end pipeline runs from PR â†’ staging and an approval-promoted production deploy.
